\abstract{YAGL is a programming language for generating graphics in SVG format from JSON formatted data.
}

\section{The Proposal}
\subsection{Description of YAGL}
YAGL is a new programming language for constructing graphics, with the intent of allowing programmers to construct graphics with various different output formats.\\

The language features a static type system with a void type that can conditionally downcast to the other primitives (Int, Array, etc..).  Types are indicated by the type name declarator followed by the variable name.  All types are objects.  Each object holds an enumeration for what its type is, along with the underlying data.  There is no string type.  There are integer and array literals.\\

There are limited control structures: an iterated for loop, an if statement and break.  A for loop can iterate on Stream and Array types and will yield a void type as the iterated item which needs to be downcast.

YAGL formatted JSON data must contain the following keys:\\


\subsection{What Does YAGL Solve?}
YAGL allows users to take JSON formatted data and produce clear and concise graphs. The properties of these graphs (such as color) can be manipulated utilizing algorithms. The output of the YAGL program can be determined by the user (SVG, ASCII, or PDF). YAGL is essentially and clean and minimal language for producing graphs quickly and easily.

\subsection{Examples of YAGL Syntax}
YAGL will have a void type, which cannot be operated upon. The void type can be conditionally downcast using the syntax:
\begin{lstlisting}
if let b = a as Int {
	# scope of b is only in this function 
}
\end{lstlisting}
This allows us to safely operate on JSON streams.\\

YAGL does not have a string type. In order to pipe in filenames to open JSON files, the open open keyword takes in \$[n] which specifies the $n{th}$ command line parameter. $open$ constructs a Stream.
\begin{lstlisting}
Stream s = open $0
\end{lstlisting}

YAGL has an iterated for loop and array literals:
\begin{lstlisting}
Stream s = open $0
\end{lstlisting}
YAGL has an iterated for loop and array literals:
\begin{lstlisting}
for a in [[4,1,5], 3, 5, [2, 3]] {
	if (let int_a = a as Int) {
	}
	elif (let int_a = a as Array) { }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Example YAGL Program}
\begin{lstlisting}
func canvas(Array: param1)
{
	Canvas myGraph = new Canvas()
	# 0 is ascii art graph, 1 is SVG meant for a browser, 2 is PDF?
	myGraph.graphType = 0
	# Opens up command line argument, presumably JSON.
	Stream s = open $0
	for (item in s)
	{	# Say there are only 3 enums of types
		# 0 is integer, 1 is array, 2 is canvas Object
		if (let integer_item = item as Int)
		{
			myGraph.addRectAllParams(item)
		}
		elif (let array_item = item as Array)
		{
			myGraph.addRect(item[0], item[1], item[2], item[3])
		}
	}
}

# Notice Last item is a nested Array 
myData = [3, 4, 5, 1, [3, 1, 5, 6]]
build canvas(myData)

## Standard Library - preview graph with predefined parameters, 
spits out ascii art graph to standard output preview(data)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{More Example Code}
Below is an example program written in the YAGL language.

\begin{lstlisting}
# This is an example of a YAGL program. 
# There is one global object always available, the Graph object that you 
# don't have a handle on, but will manipulate with canvas
Array myJson = jsonArray(``/path/to/json/data.json'')

#Could also do jsonDict which returns Dict 
func createGraph()
{
    for (Dict item in myJson)
    {   # Assuming everything in item[``foo''] is string and adding a rect to the gm[``xCoord''], item[``yCoord''], item[``height''], item[``width''])
        #OR!
        addCircle(item[``cx''], item[``cy''], item[``r'']
    }   #Builtin function that provides a title to the global singleton svg object. 
    title(``YAET, Yet Another Example Title'')
}

createGraph()
# Need to call canvas for the graph to be actually made
canvas(<nameOfFile>, <width>, <height>)

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Language Reference Manual}

\subsection{Introduction}
This manual describes the YAGL programming language as specified by the YAGL team. 

\subsection{Lexical Conventions}
A YAGL program is written in the 7-bit ASCII character set and is divided into a number of logical lines. A logical line terminates by the token SEMI, where a logical line is constructed from one or more physical lines. A physical line is a sequence of ASCII characters that are terminated by a semi-colon character.

\subsubsection{Tokens}
A logical line may consist of the following tokens assuming correct syntax is used: \\
SEMI, LPAREN, RPAREN, LBRACE, RBRACE, COMMA, COLON, IN, LBRACK, RBRACK, PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, DIVIDE, ASSIGN, FUNC, EQ, NEQ, LT, LEQ, GT, GEQ, RETURN, IF, ELSE, FOR, WHILE. 

\subsubsection{Comments} 
Comments are introduced by '/*' and last until they encounter the next '*/'.

\subsubsection{Identifiers}
An identifier is a sequence of ASCII alphanumeric characters and the underscore character where upper and lower case are distinct; ASCII digits may not be included in an identifier.  Identifiers must start with a lowercase letter.

\subsubsection{Keywords}
The following is an enumeration of all the keywords required by a YAGL implementation:
`if`, `else`, `for`, `in`, `func`, `return`, `while`, 'this'.  Identifiers cannot have the same name as keywords.

\subsubsection{Built-in Functions}
The following functions are built-in:\\
print(String: x), print\_int(Int: x), addRect(Int: width, Int: height, Int: x, Int: y, String: color, String: border\_color), addCircle(Int: r, Int: cx, Int: cy, String: color, String: border\_color), text(String: title, Int: x, Int: y, Int: size), canvas(Int: width, Int: height)

\subsubsection{String Literals}
YAGL string literals begin with a double-quote (“) followed by a finite sequence of non-double-quote ASCII characters and close with a double-quote (“). YAGL strings do not recognize escape sequences. An example of a YAGL string literal is String bar = “Hello World”.

\subsubsection{Integer Literals}
YAGL supports integer literals.  An integer literal is a sequence of digits that does not lead with 0. Integer literals are base 10 and are the only type of numeric literal recognized by the language. Integer literals can only be positive.  Additionally, integer literals will use 64 bits.

\subsubsection{Operators}
The following tokens are operators:
‘+’, ‘-’, ‘*’, ‘/’, ‘$>$’, ‘$<$’, ‘$<=$’, ‘$>=$’, ‘==’, ‘=’

\subsubsection{Basic Types}
YAGL features four built-in data types, String, Array, Integer, and Dictionary. String represents string objects, Arrays represent an ordered sequence of Integers or Dictionaries. Arrays must have all elements of the same type.  Dictionaries represent an implementation of a key-value storage system and are mainly used as a YAGL container for JSON data. Dictionaries may have only Strings as keys and their values are integers. Arrays and Dictionaries are iterable and hence may be used in the declaration of a for loop. 

\subsection{Data Model}
As YAGL’s primarily purpose is a language to programmatically create SVGs (scalable vector graphics), it makes sense to have just one global “SVG” Object. In addition, YAGL supports one global reference to a Dictionary of JSON data. The reference does not need an explicit handle, a simple call to openJson is enough to establish this global variable. A YAGL environment also provides a handle to a "this" object. The "this" object refers to a previously opened Dictionary via an open JSON call.

\subsection{JSON Protocol}
The YAGL spec recommends that JSON data passed to the 
builtin function openJson be of the following format:
\begin{lstlisting}
[{"height":<Integer Literal>, "width":<Integer Literal>,
 "x":<Integer Literal>, "y":<Integer Literal>}...]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Expressions}
The precedence of expression operators will first prioritize function calls, then parentheses, then multiplication/division/modulo, then addition and subtraction.  

\subsection{Array References}
An array identifier followed by a set of square brackets enclosing an integer value to denote the index denotes array indexing, i.e. myArray[4].  Array indexing returns an integer value.  Indexing out of bounds in an array causes a compile time error.  Arrays start at index 0, and a legal index is any index from 0 to the number of elements in the array minus 1.

\subsection{Dictionary References}
A Dictionary identifier followed by a set of square brackets enclosing a string literal performs a lookup. Performing a lookup on a Dictionary where the key does not exist returns -1, else it returns the integer value associated with the key.

\subsection{Function Calls}
A function call is a postfix expression which is performed by the identifier of the function
followed by a possibly empty set of parentheses. Functions may return an explicit value to their caller if they have a return expression defined in their body, else they return 0.  return is a statement that takes an expression, evaluates it, then returns it as the value of the expression where the function is called.

\subsection{Operators}

\subsubsection{Multiplicative Operators}
The multiplicator operators *, /, follow the usual rules of mathematics and group left to right, where \* denotes multiplication, / denotes division. Division by 0 is undefined.  Division will also truncate decimal parts of numbers to the nearest integer lower than the mathematical division.

\subsubsection{Additive Operators}
The additive operators +, - group left to right where + denotes addition and - denotes subtraction

\subsubsection{Relational Operators}
The relational operators group left to right and return back 1 if the operator evaluates to true and 0 if the operator evaluates to false. 
 
\subsubsection{Equality Operators}
The equality operator == is only valid for either Integer or String types and returns 1 if the operands are equal, 0 otherwise. 

\subsubsection{Assignment Expressions}
There is only one assignment operator, =.  The equals operator accepts a type declaration along with a NAME token for its left operand and an expression for its right operand. 
 
\subsubsection{Comma Operator}
A pair of expressions separated by 0 without need of an explicit return declaration. The parameter list is a comma-separated series of identifiers with type names (for example, (Int: a, Int: b, Int: c).  The parameter list can also be empty and just be an empty set of parenthesis. 

\subsection{Scope}

\subsubsection{Lexical Scope}
Identifiers are placed into non-intersecting namespaces.  The two namespaces are functions and file level.  The lexical scope of an object or function identifier that appears in a block begins at the end of its declarator and persists to the end of the block in which it appears.  The scope of a parameter of a function begins at the start of the function block and extends to the end.  If an identifier is reused at the head of a block or as a function parameter, any other declaration of the identifier is shadowed until the end of the block or function. 

\subsubsection{Iteration Statements}
\textit{While} loops expects an expression and a statement body. The while loop repeats the expression body until the expression yields zero.

\textit{iterate} introduces a block which is executed 
for the length of the JSON data. 

\subsubsection{If Statements}

In an \textit{if} statement, the expression is evaluated, including side-effects, and \textit{if} the result is not 0, the first sub-statement is executed. If it is equal to 0, the else sub-statement is executed if it exists.

\subsection{Grammar}
This is the comprehensive Grammar for the YAGL programming language. The grammar has terminal symbols NAME, INTEGER, STRING, , OPERATORs, which includes "+", "-", "/", "*", and PUNCTUATION which includes "(", ")", "{", and "}". Note that * after a regular expression denotes zero or more instances of the expression, + denotes one or more instances and ? denotes one or zero.

\begin{lstlisting}
type_spec: Array | Dict | Int | String
return_stmt: ‘return’ [expr]
func_definition: 'func' NAME parameters ‘{‘ suite ‘}’
suite: simple_stmt | compound_stmt
simple_stmt: (expr_stmt | print_stmt) NEWLINE

\section{Architectural Design}
The YAGL internal stack begins with the a lexical tokenizer. The tokenizer converts a stream of chars into a 
list of tokens in accordance with YAGL's grammar. The resultant list is then passed to a parser which creates an 
abstract syntax tree. This AST is then passed to a 
semantic analyzer which stops the compilation process
upon encountering a semantic error, i.e. adding a String to an Integer. If the semantic analysis succeeds, the AST 
passes to the code generator. At this stage, code generation starts and outputs a single C++ source code file. 

\section{Test Plan}
The test regression suite is located under the \textbf{/tests/} subdirectory. There are tests for full YAGL functionality as well as MicroC tests to compare their output to.\\\\

To execute the entire testsuite, simply execute \textbf{./runyagl} from the command-line.

\section{Lessons Learned}
The following lessons were learned during the course of this project:\\

\subsection{Start Earlier}
Time is everything and it would have been less stressful to start earlier. This was an expected problem, as there seems to always be room for improvement.
